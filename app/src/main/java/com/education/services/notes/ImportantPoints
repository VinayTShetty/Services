Android service is a component that is used to perform operations on the background
such as playing music, handle network transactions, interacting content providers etc. It doesn't has any UI (user interface).
The service runs in the background indefinitely even if application is destroyed.

There can be two forms of a service.The lifecycle of service can follow two different paths: started or bound.
 Started
 Bound

 1) Started Service

 A service is started when component (like activity) calls startService() method, now it runs in the background indefinitely.
 It is stopped by stopService() method. The service can stop itself by calling the stopSelf() method.


Starter Service Run on the MainThread.
After Orieo release Service running in the background has limitation.


2) Bound Service

A service is bound when another component (e.g. client) calls bindService() method.
The client can unbind the service by calling the unbindService() method.
The service cannot be stopped until all clients unbind the service
